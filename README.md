# About
## What is FastForward?
FastForward is the successor of Universal Bypass (see below), a browser extension that can bypass annoying link shorteners, so you don't need to waste your time _trying_ to get to the final link.

You can see the extension in action in [our official website](https://fastforward.team/example-links).

## What happened to Universal Bypass?
As you may know, [Universal Bypass](https://github.com/Sainan/Universal-Bypass) is no longer maintained by its original developer, [Sainan](https://github.com/Sainan), who had worked on it for so long.\
 \
Thanks Sainan for your hard work.



## Does FastForward have a Discord server?
Yes! If you are interested in assisting the development, need help, or just wanna hang out, you can [click here to join](https://discord.gg/RSAf7b5njt) our server.

## Why is FastForward no longer on the Chrome Web Store?
Google believes that FastForward bypasses paywalls and other restrictions, which is not true nor is the purpose of this extension. Specifically, Google did not approve of the Linkvertise bypass after alerts by the website.
We are currently working with Google to get the extension back on the Chrome Web Store, but for now you can install it manually on Chromium-based browsers. As of right now, Microsoft and Firefox have kept FastForward up on their respective stores. Our [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/876622516607656006/876951955841372181) has more information about the removal and how to reinstall FastForward and any necessary bypasses. Read below for steps on how to manually install FastForward.
