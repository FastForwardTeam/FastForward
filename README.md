# About
## What is FastForward?
FastForward is the successor of Universal Bypass (see below), a browser extension that can bypass annoying link shorteners, so you don't need to waste your time _trying_ to get on the final link.

You can see the extension in action in [our official website](https://fastforward.team/example-links).

## What happened to Universal Bypass?
As you may know, [Universal Bypass](https://github.com/Sainan/Universal-Bypass) is no longer maintained by its original developer, [Sainan](https://github.com/Sainan), who had worked on it for so long.\
Thanks Sainan for your hard work.

## Does FastForward have a Discord server?
Yes! We do, and if you are interested in assisting the development, need help or just wanna hang out, you can [click here to join](https://discord.gg/RSAf7b5njt) to our server.
