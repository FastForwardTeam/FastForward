# Universal Bypass

Don't waste your time with compliance. Universal Bypass automatically skips annoying link shorteners.

As you may know, universal bypass is no longer maintained by its original developer, Sainan, who had worked on it for so long. Thanks to them, we have what we do today, and I wish to continue his work. I'm not too sure where to start, and I need your help, so join the discord and we'll go from there. https://discord.gg/RSAf7b5njt

Thanks Sainan for your hard work.
