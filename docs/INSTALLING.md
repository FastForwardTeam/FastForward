## Manual Installation
These are the instructions for installing the extension in "unpacked" mode.

### Chrome, Chromium, Kiwi, Opera, Opera GX, Vivaldi, Brave etc.
Make sure to read carefully to avoid any errors.

0. **REMOVE any previous versions of FastForward.**

1. Download the extension using [this link](https://nightly.link/FastForwardTeam/FastForward/workflows/main/main/FastForward_chromium.zip). You'll end with a .zip file on your downloads, like on the screenshot below:
![1](https://i.imgur.com/Nrdgd7R.png)

2. Now unzip the file, using any software you prefer. In the screenshot below, I used [7-zip](https://7-zip.org) to unzip the file.
![2](https://i.imgur.com/93GYoCm.png)

3. Now you'll have a folder called "FastForward_chromium". Enter it and extract (again) the file.

You can do this either using 7-zip:
![3-1](https://i.imgur.com/sQGRJXq.gif)


Or renaming the file extension, like on the gif below:
![3-2](https://i.imgur.com/JkhCV4q.gif)


4. Open the extensions page on your browser (type `chrome://extensions/` on the address bar) and turn on "Developer Mode", like in the image below.

5. Now click on "Load unpacked", and select the folder where Fast Forward was extracted.

6. If you got any errors, or a message like "You're using FastForward in development mode", see the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

#### CRX Install
You can also use auto-updating builds for Google Chrome (Windows, Linux & macOS), Brave (Windows, Linux & macOS), Kiwi (Android), Ungoogled Chromium and Edge. We do not recommend installing from this method if you aren't an experienced user. If you're having trouble installing this way, please install the extension manually.

## Troubleshooting
<details> <summary> "Manifest version 2 is deprecated, and support will be removed in 2023. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/ for more details." </summary>
  <br>

Just click on "clear all", this is just a warning, not an error.  
We are currently working on migrating the extension to MV3 to meet Google's deadlines.

<details> <summary> "You're using FastForward in development mode, which means that bypass definitions are loaded from your local injection_script.js and rules.json. If you would like to use the auto-updating system, delete those files and then check for updates." </summary>
  <br>

Go to the folder where you extracted Fast Forward, and delete the two files below:
