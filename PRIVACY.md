# Universal Bypass Privacy Policy

## Auto-updating

*This section does not apply to Firefox.*

In order to provide up-to-date bypasses, Universal Bypass sends a request to Github every hour, and if a new commit is found, it will download the latest "injection script."

For this, [Github's privacy policy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) applies.

## Crowd Bypass

When Crowd Bypass (Options > "Give and take the destinations of unbypassable shorteners.") is enabled, ocassionally the extension will send requests to my server:

- When you visit a known unbypassable shortener website, the URL is sent so it can check against the database if someone else has already reported its destination.
- When you complete your visit on such a website, the URL and destination URL are sent so it can be recorded for future visitors.

I keep no request logs. I use Clouflare and [their privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) applies to you as an "End User."
